## Readability

- **Line length**: Keep lines around 80 characters or less, good general rule of thumb for designing layouts.
- **Type alignment**: Content is typically left-aligned and ragged right. Centering, and right-aligning text is atypical.
- **Letter spacing:** Letter-spacing is almost never modified. Generally speaking, avoid tweaking letter spacing.
- **Styling text:** Not very common to italicize or underline body text. Refrain from using these stylings. Emphasise (bold) is more common and preferred for visual focus.

## Type components

Which font and scale to use depends on the context it being used in. I define roughly 4 categories of typographic components.

| Value   | Name | Description           | Token                  |
| ------- | ---- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Display | bim  | Such as headings      | `var(--color-primary)` |
| Body    | bim  | Long-form text        | `var(--color-primary)` |
| Details | bim  | Links, buttons etc.   | `var(--color-primary)` |
| Code    | bim  | Snippets, alerts etc. | `var(--color-primary)` |

## Font weights

Body text is set in the **regular** weight. Headings are set in **bold** weight. _Light_ and _medium_ are not used often but sometimes for labels and smaller components.

| Value   | Name | Description           | Token                  |
| ------- | ---- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Light   | bim  | Such as headings      | `var(--color-primary)` |
| Regular | bim  | Long-form text        | `var(--color-primary)` |
| Medium  | bim  | Links, buttons etc.   | `var(--color-primary)` |
| Bold    | bim  | Snippets, alerts etc. | `var(--color-primary)` |

## Type scale

The typographic system has a **Major second (1.125)** type scale. This means that each size is multiplied or divided by 1.125 (rounded off) from the previous size, starting with the base size of **16px**. The typographic scale are labelled to _lettered size scales._ The minimum font-size for legilibility reasons is 16px.

| Value   | Font-size | Description      | Token                  |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| text-xs | `1.2rem`  | Such as headings | `var(--color-primary)` |
| text-s  | bim       | Long-form text   | `var(--color-primary)` |

## Line height

The typography system uses a **0.25 (incremental) multiplier** for line-heights.

| Value   | Name | Description      | Token                  |
| ------- | ---- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| line-xs | bim  | Such as headings | `var(--color-primary)` |
| line-s  | bim  | Long-form text   | `var(--color-primary)` |
