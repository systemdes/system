## System Architecture

### Sensible defaults

The foundational visual language is opinionated, it's based on what I generally deem _good design_. The design language should be treated as a baseline layer but can be expanded upon as seemed fit.

### Tool-agnostic

The colors and typography etc. consist of the 'raw materials' so there values or in most systems called 'tokens'. Tools change, values and principles do not. The complete design systems aims to be tool independent so they can be implemented in any technical system or design software.
