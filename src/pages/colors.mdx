## Palette

My personal colors are based on a neutral _monochromatic_ color palette. It's a _spectrum_ of 8 tints and shades from white to black creating a grey color theme. Just these tints allow for varying with tints to create hierarchy and elevation but also themes (e.g. light / dark mode) by inverting the spectrum.

## Naming

In the system of design tokens the tints are labelled in _hundreds_ better known as the _numeric weight scale_. The outermost colors on the spectrum are just **white** and **black**. Everything in between is a value between 100 and 900 to determine it's saturation.
